I should be able to enter values like that in an in put text : (2 + 6 + 4)/5
your tool need to parse the string provided to extract the calculs to do and display the result
the operations can be : "+" "-" "/" "*"
you need to take care of the ( ) that will set the priority of the calculs

I will evaluate your ability to create libraries (object oriented if needed),
the structure of your code and what you can do in 2 or 3hours.
Please send me back your script (with comments) and the time you took to do it.
